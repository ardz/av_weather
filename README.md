### Introduction

Thanks for taking some time out to take part in our Aveva technical challenge.
The challenge

You will find attached to this challenge a weather forecast file in JSON format named
WeatherForecast.json. The file itself represents a response from a weather API. This is going to
serve as the basis for the challenge and must be used as your only source of data.
Your challenge is to read in this data source and write a number of tests that assert on as many of
the conditions listed as you can:

1. There is no rainfall for day 1 in London

2. There are the correct number of entries for London

3. We do not know the population of New York

4. The pressure rose in New York from day 1

5. The rainfall in London is only over half an inch twice

6. London will be overcast for the whole of day 5

7. The temperature in New York is always within of 24 degrees Celsius

### The rules
